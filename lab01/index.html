<p style="background-color:grey;">A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than goods.?</p>
<p style="color: blue;">The most popular car colours as of 2012 were greyscale colours, with over 70% of cars produced globally being white, black, grey or silver. Red, blue and brown/beige cars ranged between 6% and 10% each, while all other colours amounted to less than 5%.</p>
<p style="background: aqua;">The model of a car is the name used by a manufacturer to market a range of similar cars. The methods used by car manufacturers to categorise their product range into models varies between manufacturers.</p>
<p style="color: chocolate;">An engine or motor is a machine designed to convert one form of energy into mechanical energy.Heat engines convert heat into work via various thermodynamic processes. The internal combustion engine is perhaps the most common example of a heat engine, in which heat from the combustion of a fuel causes rapid pressurisation of the gaseous combustion products in the combustion chamber, causing them to expand and drive a piston, which turns a crankshaft. Electric motors convert electrical energy into mechanical motion, pneumatic motors use compressed air, and clockwork motors in wind-up toys use elastic energy. In biological systems, molecular motors, like myosins in muscles, use chemical energy to create forces and ultimately motion.</p>
